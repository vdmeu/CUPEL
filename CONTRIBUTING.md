# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cupel (Professional Competence Provenance Framework).

## Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA)

All contributions require signing a Contributor Licence Agreement before your first pull request can be merged. The CLA ensures that:

1. You retain copyright over your contributions.
2. You grant the project sufficient rights to distribute your contributions under the AGPL-3.0 licence.
3. You grant the project the right to include your contributions in commercially-licensed components (open core model), with attribution.

The CLA will be made available in this repository once the project reaches Phase 1. Until then, contributions are welcome as issues and discussions.

## How to Contribute

### Right Now (Phase 0)

The most valuable contributions at this stage are:

- **Review and critique** the genesis document and analytical foundation
- **Identify gaps** in the market landscape analysis
- **Suggest existing standards** or initiatives we should interoperate with
- **Challenge assumptions** — the framework is stronger when stress-tested

Open an issue to start a discussion.

### Phase 1 and Beyond

- Schema design and review
- Technical specification drafting
- Domain-specific trust signal definitions (legal, medical, engineering, finance, etc.)
- Reference implementation development
- Documentation and governance

## Code of Conduct

Be constructive, be specific, be respectful. Cupel exists because trust infrastructure matters — let's build the community with the same integrity we want to embed in the standard.

## Licence

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's AGPL-3.0 licence (subject to CLA terms for commercially-licensed components).
